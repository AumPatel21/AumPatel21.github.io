                        Umass Lowell pursuing a bachelors in Computer Science. I came to the
                        US in May 2019, from India with my parents after spending 
                        16 years of my live there. It took me a while to get 
                        used to the new environment and the people here. Just when 
                        I thought things were getting better, the pandemic hit and 
                        all my classes were moved online. Although it was hard to 
                        adjust in these, conditions, it taught me to be resilient
                        and appreciate life more.<br>&emsp; I used to do taekwondo 
                        for over a decade in India and I was able to earn a black belt in 
                        it and also earning 2 gold medals in sparring. After coming to 
                        college I also started reading a lot of manga. Vagabond by Takehiko Inoue
                        is my favourite manga because of the extra ordinary art and philosophical 
                        teachings. Over the summer, I also bought an electric guitar just to 
                        learn a new skill and challenge myself and I try to practice whenever I 
                        get the chance.
