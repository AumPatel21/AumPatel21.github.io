                <h4>A Simple Calculator using HTML/CSS/Js</h4>
                <p>Before planning to take the GUI class, I wished to learn more about HTML and CSS and 
                    This simple calculator that I made over the winter break in 2022 refreshed my memory 
                    about HTML. This was a fun project that helped me understand more about HTMl but especially CSS
                    since I had never used it before and it was very fun to learn. I really enjoyed implementing this project
                    because being able to play around with the CSS and see the changes in real time was very satisfying. I often 
                    ran into alignment issues and it was very fun to solve them. This calculator can perform all 
                    the basic calculation. It can handle decimal calculations and also give answers to very large 
                    numbers. <br>
