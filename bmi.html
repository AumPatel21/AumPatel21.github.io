            <h4>A BMI calculator to get your Body Mass Index!</h4>
            <p>This was the first time I attempted to create something using HTML and CSS. 
                Before making the calculator, I had to learn the basics of HTML and CSS so I 
                decided to try learning them by making a simple BMI calculator. This calculator
                can calculate the BMI of a person and also tell them if they are underweight,
                normal, overweight or obese. To obtain our BMI, we just have to enter our height 
                in feet and inches and weight in pounds as it says on the picture above. Although 
                this calculator is very simple, it was a great learning experience for me and it 
                helped me understand the basics of HTML and CSS. I wished at the time to make a toggle 
                switch to change the height input from feet and inches to centimeters and weight input 
                from pounds to kilograms but I couldn't understand how to do it at the time. I hope to 
                implement it in the future.
