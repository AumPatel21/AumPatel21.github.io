                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p id="info">Sokoban is a tile based block pushing game where the user pushed the boxes 
                    in a warehouse to it's designated/available locations. The player can only push the boxes and cannot pull them.
                    The player can also not push more than one box at a time. The player can move up, down, left and right. The player
                    If the player can no longer move the boxes (e.g. box is stuck in a corner), the game is over. The player can choose 
                    to restart the game at any time, even after winning. The game is over when all the boxes are in their designated locations.

                <!-- Implementation details -->
                <h3>Implementation (C++, SFML)</h3>
                <p>The implementation of this game was done using C++ and the SFML library. For me this was one of the most fun and 
                    stressful assignment throughout Computing 4! The algorithm for this program was quite tricky and took a lot of time 
                    for me to figure out but it was a very rewarding feeling when I finished it. The user can play the game by using the
                    arrow keys or W, A, S, D keys. The game can be restarted using the R key and user can quit the game using the ESC key.
